Option 1 - Under the StickHeroProject folder, we run the command mvn clean javafx:run 

Option 2 - Go to the attached file

The default username is admin. Password is also admin.
Username - admin

Everything is controlled by the left mouse click. To grow the stick, click on the mouse. To stop growing the stick and rotate it, it can be done by another mouse click.

As a part of the bonus, we have also used threading and incorporated that into our project. An additional feature we have added is that the hero gets 3 lives in the form of hearts. After the hero's lives are over, the game automatically terminates.
